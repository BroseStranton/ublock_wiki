If you indicate to µBlock that you are an advanced user (from the _Settings_ tab in µBlock's dashboard), µBlock will behave slightly differently and also will make available features which are more suitable to advanced users. **Use these advanced features at your own risks.**

Below are differences between normal mode and advanced user mode.

#### No tool tips

Tool tips are useful for novice users, but can become annoying to advanced users. Tool tips are turned off for advanced users.

#### Dynamic filtering

Dynamic filtering will become available to advanced users. Novice users could easily mess up µBlock's filtering through dynamic filtering, thus it is not available by default.
