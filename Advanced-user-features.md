If you indicate to µBlock that you are an advanced user (from the _Settings_ tab in µBlock's dashboard), µBlock will behave slightly differently and also will make available features which are more suitable to advanced users.

**Use these advanced features at your own risks.**

Below are differences between normal mode and advanced user mode.

Also, advanced users are expected to read the documentation. If you think the documentation needs more work, you are very welcome to contribute (it's a wiki, you can edit without asking permission -- I will just ensure all is technically accurate.)

#### No tool tips

Tool tips are useful for novice users, but can become annoying to advanced users. Tool tips are turned off for advanced users.

#### Dynamic filtering

Dynamic filtering ([quick guide](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dynamic-filtering:-quick-guide)) will become available to advanced users. Novice users could easily mess up µBlock's filtering through dynamic filtering, thus it is not available by default.

**Important note:** Dynamic filtering engine is completely turned off when you un-check the setting _"I am an advanced user"_. Your dynamic filtering rules are kept intact though, in case you re-enable _advanced user_ mode again.
