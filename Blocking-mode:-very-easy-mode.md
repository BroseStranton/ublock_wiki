This mode is more suitable for those who are little concerned about their privacy. Only advertisements are blocked, as per _EasyList_ filters. This mode is closer to what you get with default Adblock Plus settings (when you disable ABP's _acceptable ads_ filter list).

Advantages:
- Very low likelihood of web pages being broken.
- Web page will load faster than if using no blocker at all.

Disadvantages:
- Privacy exposure reduction is only incidental to blocking ads.

##### How to enable this mode
