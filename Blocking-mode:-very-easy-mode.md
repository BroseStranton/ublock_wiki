This mode is more suitable for those who are little concerned about their privacy. Only advertisements are blocked, as per [_EasyList_ filters](https://easylist.adblockplus.org/en/). This mode is closer to what you get with default Adblock Plus settings (when you disable ABP's _acceptable ads_ filter list).

##### Characteristics

- Very low likelihood of web pages being broken.
- Web pages will load faster than if using no blocker at all.
- Privacy exposure reduction is only incidental.

##### How to enable this mode

_Settings_ pane:
- _I am an advanced user_: unchecked.

_3rd-party filters_ pane:
- _EasyList_: checked
- All other filter lists: unchecked
