[Back to _Blocking mode_](./Blocking-mode)

***

Roughly similar to using Adblock Plus with _EasyList_ only.

This mode is more suitable for those who are little concerned about their privacy. Only advertisements are blocked, as per [_EasyList_ filters](https://easylist.github.io/). This mode is closer to what you get with default Adblock Plus settings (when you disable ABP's _acceptable ads_ filter list).

##### Characteristics

- Very low likelihood of web pages being broken.
- Web pages will load faster than if using no blocker at all.
- Privacy exposure reduction is rather incidental.

##### How to enable this mode

_Settings_ pane:
- _I am an advanced user_: unchecked.

_Filter lists_ pane:
- _uBlock filtersâ€Ž_: checked
- _EasyList_: checked
- All other filter lists: unchecked.
