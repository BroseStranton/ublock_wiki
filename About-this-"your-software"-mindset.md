This is a response to the "your software" mindset I have seen many times. I will quote a statement from a real occurrence (the context does not matter). My emphasis:

> You should appreciate people using **your** software and **taking the time** to report bugs.

This statement has bothered me when I read it, because it misses completely the big picture.

> **your** software

uBlock is licensed GPLv3. If you click the "Fork" button at the top of a project's Github page, **this software becomes yours**.

Try it.

So now that this software is **yours**, re-consider this part of the sentence:

> taking the time

Now that the software is **yours**, what apparently you saw as some sort of favor ("taking the time"), was actually a favor to yourself in retrospect, and also in retrospect, you hopefully can now appreciate the _huge_ amount of time spent by others on what is now **your** software.
