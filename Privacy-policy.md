uBlock Origin does not collect any data of any kind.

- uBlock Origin has no home server.
- uBlock Origin doesn't embed any kind of analytic hooks in its code.

The only time uBlock Origin connects to a remote server is to update the filter lists and other related assets. If you disable auto-update in the _"3rd-party filters"_ pane in the dashboard, uBlock Origin will not connect to any remote server, unless you click _"Update now"_ and only if there are assets deemed "out of date".

The servers behind `githubusercontent.com` are owned by GitHub, Inc., and thus are unrelated to uBlock Origin, so even if I was interested in analytics (which I am not), I have no access to whatever data is logged by `githubusercontent.com`.

That is all.
