uBlock Origin does not collect any data of any kind.

- uBlock Origin has no home server.
- uBlock Origin doesn't embed any kind of analytic hooks in its code.

If you have _"Auto-update filter lists"_ checked, uBlock Origin will download once in a while the resource at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/assets/checksums.txt`, to find out whether some assets used by uBlock Origin must be updated. The server(s) behind `githubusercontent.com` are owned by GitHub, Inc., and thus are unrelated to uBlock Origin, so even if I was interested in analytics (which I am not), I have no access to whatever data is logged by `githubusercontent.com`.

That is all.
