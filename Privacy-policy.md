uBlock Origin (uBO) does not collect any data of any kind.

- uBO has no home server.
- uBO doesn't embed any analytic or telemetry hooks in its code.
- uBO doesn't accept donations or any other form of financing.

The only time uBO connects to a remote server is to update the filter lists and other related assets. If you disable auto-update in the "Filter lists" pane in the dashboard, uBO will not connect to any remote server unless you click "Update now" and only if there are assets deemed "out of date."

**GitHub** is used to host the uBO project. **GitHub, Inc.** (a subsidiary of **Microsoft Corporation**) owns **GitHub** and is unrelated to uBO.

That is all.
