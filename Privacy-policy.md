uBlock Origin does not collect any data of any kind.

- uBlock Origin has no home server.
- uBlock Origin doesn't embed any kind of analytic hooks in its code.

The only time uBlock Origin connects to a remote server is to update the filter lists and other related assets. If you disable auto-update in the _"3rd-party filters"_ pane in the dashboard, uBlock Origin will not connect to any remote server, unless you click _"Update now"_ and only if there are assets deemed "out of date".

The project is currently hosted on `github.com`, which is owned by GitHub, Inc., and thus is unrelated to uBlock Origin.

That is all.
