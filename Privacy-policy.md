uBlock Origin (uBO) does not collect any data of any kind.

- uBO has no home server.
- uBO doesn't embed any kind of analytic or telemetry hooks in its code.
- uBO doesn't accept donations or any other form of financing.

The only time uBO connects to a remote server is to update the filter lists and other related assets. If you disable auto-update in the _"Filter lists"_ pane in the dashboard, uBO will not connect to any remote server, unless you click _"Update now"_ and only if there are assets deemed "out of date".

The project is currently hosted on `github.com`, which is owned by **GitHub Inc**. (now a subsidiary of **Microsoft Corporation**), and thus is unrelated to uBO.

That is all.
