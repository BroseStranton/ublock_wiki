uBlock Origin does not collect any data of any kind.

- uBlock Origin has no home server.
- uBlock Origin doesn't embed any kind of analytic hooks in its code.

uBlock Origin will download the resource at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/assets/checksums.txt` ...

- when you visit the _3rd-party filters_ pane in the dashboard;
- once in a while if you have _Auto-update filter lists_ checked;

... to find out whether some assets used by uBlock Origin need to be updated.

The servers behind `githubusercontent.com` are owned by GitHub, Inc., and thus are unrelated to uBlock Origin, so even if I was interested in analytics (which I am not), I have no access to whatever data is logged by `githubusercontent.com`.

That is all.
