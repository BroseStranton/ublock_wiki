Default-deny is an awesome blocking mode for whoever is ready for the task of having to un-break web sites during the first visit, and agrees that in general most 3rd-party resources from web pages:

- are not really needed
- increase privacy exposure

The benefits of using default-deny are plenty:

- Significantly faster page load
- Significant reduction of bandwidth consumption
- Significant reduction of privacy exposure
- Easier on your browser's memory and CPU footprint

> working on it.. topic to cover:
> 
> no need to use malware domain lists since all 3rd-parties are blocked by default = leaner uBlock
>
> ubiquitous servers blocked by default, i.e. no need to pre-emptively block facebook, google, twitter, linkdin, etc. to prevent tracking by these
>
> provide many examples of how easy it is to un-break websites, including worst case scenario of simply setting the `3rd-party` cell to `noop` to completely disengage default-deny for one specific web site, if it gets too complicated
