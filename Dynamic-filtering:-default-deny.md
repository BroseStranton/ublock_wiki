Default-deny is an awesome blocking mode for whoever agrees that most 3rd-party resources from web pages is useless, and an encroachment on privacy, and for whoever is ready for the annoyance of having to un-break web sites during the first visit.

- Significantly faster page load
- Easier on your browser's memory and CPU footprint
- Significant reduction of privacy exposure
