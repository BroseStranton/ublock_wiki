Collection of question which has been asked, along with the answer I provided.

#### How often are filter lists updated?

Currently, after four days a filter lists is deemed "obsolete".

#### How to show the google text ads?

You can create a whitelist directive *only* for Google search page. For example, in my case it would be:

    www.google.ca/search*

In your case, just replace `google.ca` with whatever is your Google search domain name.

Whitelist directives are those appearing in the _Whitelist_ tab in µBlock's dashboard, and which serves to disable µBlock completely.
