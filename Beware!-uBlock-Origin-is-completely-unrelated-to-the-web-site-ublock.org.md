**BEWARE!** uBlock Origin is (and has always been) **COMPLETELY UNRELATED** to the web site `ublock.org`.

The donations sought by the [individual](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/) behind `ublock.org` (_"to keeps uBlock development possible"_, [a misrepresentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin#uBlock_.28ublock.org.29)) are _not_ benefiting any of those who contributed most to create uBlock Origin ([developers](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors), [translators](https://crowdin.com/project/ublock), and all those who put efforts in opening detailed issues). For the differences between uBlock Origin and uBlock, see the unbiased [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin).
