To import a filter list, click on the blue _information_ button next to it. A new panel on the right side of the web page will open. Click on the blue _Subscribe_ button on that panel. The asset viewer will open with a banner across the top. It will contain the name and the URL of the filter list. Click on the _Subscribe_ button on the right side of the banner. The new filter list appends itself under the _Custom_ section near the bottom of the _Filter lists_ pane.
