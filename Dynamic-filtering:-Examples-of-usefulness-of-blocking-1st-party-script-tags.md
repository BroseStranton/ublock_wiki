### Example 1

URL: <http://www.eltiempo.com/>

As reported by a user in the Chrome store, links on that site do not work when _EasyPrivacy_ is used. I see this kind of problem more and more unfortunately, as more and more sites are really bent on tracking you, by rendering a site unusable if you don't let your browser download and execute javascript code which purpose is to data-mine and track you.

Dynamic filtering is helpful here though, as blocking 1st-party scripts prevent the pages from disabling the links. This will probably come at the price of breaking some parts of the pages, like comment sections, but if all you want is just read articles, it works wonder, and a very nice side effect is to make the pages on this site load **much faster**.
