### Example 1

URL: <http://www.eltiempo.com/>

As reported by a user in the Chrome store, links on that site do not work when _EasyPrivacy_ is used. I see this more and more unfortunately, as mroe and more sites are really bent on tracking you.

Dynamic filtering is helpful here though, as blocking 1st-party scripts prevent the pages from disabling the links. This will probably come at the price of breaking some parts of the pages, like comment sections, but if all you want is just read an article, it works wonder, as a very nice side effect is to make the pages on this site laod **much** faster.
