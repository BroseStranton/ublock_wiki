**Update (2015-06-25)**: Early June, I decided I will no longer contribute any code to <https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock> branch. Underhanded attempts by the current maintainer to undermine adoption of uBlock Origin made it awkward for me to contribute back.

**Update (2015-04-25)**: issue resolved, see <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/130#issuecomment-96321347>:

> The issue has been fixed, and we can all move on. I didn't know @chrisaljoudi was that young, so given this I will assume it was a fumble with no real bad intent.

[Given the resolution, no real need to keep this up.]
