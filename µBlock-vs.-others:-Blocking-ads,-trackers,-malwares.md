I ran my [reference benchmark](https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/Comparative-benchmarks-against-widely-used-blockers:-Top-15-Most-Popular-News-Websites) 
to compare against other popular blockers. (TODO: use [new reference benchmark](/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Reference-benchmark)).

Results -- figures are *3rd party* / *all*. Ordered from least 3rd-parties hit to most 3rd-parties hit:

#### µBlock 0.1.0.4

* Domains: **66** / 67
* Hosts: 117 / 171
* Scripts: 239 / 321
* Outbound cookies: 8 / 42
* Net requests: 1,035 / 1,877

#### Adblock Plus 1.8.3

* Domains: **72** / 73
* Hosts: 124 / 177
* Scripts: 243 / 328
* Outbound cookies: 8 / 44
* Net requests: 1,041 / 1,913

#### Ghostery 5.3.0

* Domains: **83** / 84
* Hosts: 140 / 211
* Scripts: 239 / 343
* Outbound cookies: 17 / 57
* Net requests: 1,046 / 1,930

#### Adguard 1.0.2.9

* Domains: **89** / 90
* Hosts: 145 / 217
* Scripts: 262 / 349
* Outbound cookies: 18 / 68
* Net requests: 1,064 / 1,904

#### Disconnect 5.18.14

* Domains: **95** / 96
* Hosts: 163 / 239
* Scripts: 283 / 381
* Outbound cookies: 18 / 74
* Net requests: 1,087 / 1,989

#### No blocker

* Domains: **380** / 381
* Hosts: 566 / 644
* Scripts: 490 / 592
* Outbound cookies: 245 / 315
* Net requests: 1,950 / 2,871

The figures show the number of requests **allowed**, thus lower numbers are better. 
The point is to show how many 3rd-party servers are hit on average after running 
the reference benchmark (three repeats in the current instance).

The less hits on 3rd-party servers, the better.

### Methodology

All blockers were configured in such a way as to compare apples-vs-apples:

- **µBlock:** out-of-the-box settings -- no change.
- **Adblock Plus:** _"EasyPrivacy"_, _"Malware Domains"_ checked. _"Acceptable ads"_ unchecked.
- **Ghostery:** _"Advertising"_, _"Analytics"_, _"Beacons"_, _"Privacy"_ checked. _"Widgets"_ not checked. _"GhostRank"_ unchecked. 
- **Adguard:** _"Spyware and tracking"_, _"Phishing and malware protection"_ checked. _"Social media"_ not checked. _"Acceptable ads"_ unchecked.
- **Disconnect:** out-of-the-box settings -- no change.

[Sessbench](https://github.com/gorhill/sessbench) was used to run the benchmarks, and each extension was tested as the only extension
active in the browser.
