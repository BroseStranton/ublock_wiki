[New benchmark results coming soon]

Using [new reference benchmark](/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Reference-benchmark).

This benchmark is to measure privacy exposure, by counting the number of **distinct 3rd-party domains** which
have been hit by net requests during the benchmark. The lower the number of distinct 3rd-party domains hit, the better.

Some benchmarks measure the amount of requests blocked, which I think is of no interest as a useful
measurement of privacy exposure. The number of requests blocked is no guarantee of less distinct 3rd-party domains being hit (and leaving a trace in the servers' log). Measuring directly the number of distinct 3rd-party domains is a much better and relevant measurement for comparison of privacy protection efficiency in my opinion.

Results -- figures are *3rd party* / *all*. Ordered from least 3rd-parties hits to most 3rd-parties hits. Privacy-wise, lower numbers are better.

### Notes

The figures show the number of requests **allowed**, thus lower numbers are better. 
The point is to show how many 3rd-party servers are hit on average after running 
the reference benchmark (three repeats in the current instance).

The less hits on 3rd-party servers, the better.

Note that Adguard send `GET` requests in the form `https://sb.adtidy.org/safebrowsing-lookup-domain.html?domain={page hostname}` for the first time a URL is visited.

### Methodology

All blockers were configured in such a way as to compare apples-vs-apples:

- **µBlock:** out-of-the-box settings -- no change.
- **Adblock Plus:** out-of-the-box settings + _"EasyPrivacy"_, _"Malware Domains"_ checked. _"Acceptable ads"_ unchecked.
- **Ghostery:** out-of-the-box settings + _"Advertising"_, _"Analytics"_, _"Beacons"_, _"Privacy"_ checked. _"Widgets"_ not checked. _"GhostRank"_ not checked. Force updated, and ensured new filters were used.
- **Adguard:** out-of-the-box settings + _"Spyware and tracking"_, _"Phishing and malware protection"_ checked. _"Social media"_ not checked. _"Acceptable ads"_ unchecked. _"Check for filter updates"_ clicked.
- **Disconnect:** out-of-the-box settings -- no change.

Browser settings (if you mind your privacy, there is no way around these settings):
- _"Click to play"_ enabled.
- _"Block third party cookies and site data"_ enabled.

[Sessbench](https://github.com/gorhill/sessbench) was used to run the benchmarks, 
and each extension was tested as the only extension active in the browser.

**Note regarding the methodology:** It has been said that I was unfair toward ABP because I didn't
use [Peter Lowe’s Ad server](http://pgl.yoyo.org/) list for ABP while I did for µBlock. It is
true that I could have imported the list into ABP, which most certainly account for the difference
between ABP and µBlock. My answer to this is available at [Wilders Security Forum](http://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/%C2%B5block-a-lean-and-fast-blocker.365273/page-3#post-2386023).
