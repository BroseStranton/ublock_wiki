[New benchmark results coming soon]

I ran my [reference benchmark](https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/Comparative-benchmarks-against-widely-used-blockers:-Top-15-Most-Popular-News-Websites) 
to compare against other popular blockers. (TODO: use [new reference benchmark](/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Reference-benchmark)).

Results -- figures are *3rd party* / *all*. Ordered from least 3rd-parties hits to most 3rd-parties hits:

#### µBlock 0.2.1.1

- Domains: **240** / 241
- Hosts: 396 / 609
- Scripts: 584 / 866
- Outbound cookies: 1 / 105
- Net requests: 2,452 / 5,007

#### Adblock Plus 1.8.3

- Domains: **251** / 252
- Hosts: 408 / 621
- Scripts: 609 / 890
- Outbound cookies: 1 / 111
- Net requests: 2,503 / 5,079

#### Ghostery 5.3.0

- [coming]

#### Adguard 1.0.2.9

- [coming]

#### Disconnect 5.18.14

- [coming]

#### No blocker

- [coming]

The figures show the number of requests **allowed**, thus lower numbers are better. 
The point is to show how many 3rd-party servers are hit on average after running 
the reference benchmark (three repeats in the current instance).

The less hits on 3rd-party servers, the better.

### Methodology

All blockers were configured in such a way as to compare apples-vs-apples:

- **µBlock:** out-of-the-box settings -- no change.
- **Adblock Plus:** _"EasyPrivacy"_, _"Malware Domains"_ checked. _"Acceptable ads"_ unchecked.
- **Ghostery:** _"Advertising"_, _"Analytics"_, _"Beacons"_, _"Privacy"_ checked. _"Widgets"_ not checked. _"GhostRank"_ not checked. 
- **Adguard:** _"Spyware and tracking"_, _"Phishing and malware protection"_ checked. _"Social media"_ not checked. _"Acceptable ads"_ unchecked.
- **Disconnect:** out-of-the-box settings -- no change.

[Sessbench](https://github.com/gorhill/sessbench) was used to run the benchmarks, 
and each extension was tested as the only extension active in the browser.

**Note regarding the methodology:** It has been said that I was unfair toward ABP because I didn't
use [Peter Lowe’s Ad server](http://pgl.yoyo.org/) list for ABP while I did for µBlock. It is
true that I could have imported the list into ABP, which most certainly account for the difference
between ABP and µBlock. My answer to this is available at [Wilders Security Forum](http://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/%C2%B5block-a-lean-and-fast-blocker.365273/page-3#post-2386023).
