uBlock Origin is an efficient and powerful content blocker: easy on memory and CPU footprint, and yet can load and enforce tens of thousands more filters than other popular blockers out there.

Usage: The big power button in the popup panel is to permanently disable/enable uBlock Origin for the CURRENT web site.

---

Flexible, it's more than an "ad blocker": it can also read and create filters from hosts files, and is also equipped to deal with anti-content blockers which purpose is to force you to disable your blocker.

Out of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:

- uBlock Origin's own filter lists
- EasyList, EasyPrivacy
- Peter Loweâ€™s Ad and tracking server list
- Online Malicious URL Blocklist

More filter lists are available for you to select if you wish, though be aware that selecting extra filter lists on top of the default ones may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.

---

Free, open source with public license (GPLv3), for users by users.

If ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.
