Doing more with less is a virtue in software. For users of ÂµBlock, this means:

- Less CPU churn when loading a web page, which may translate into noticeable faster page load.
- Free to use [more filter lists](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-lists:-gorhill):
    - For instance, [ABP warns against using too many filter lists](https://adblockplus.org/en/getting_started#subscription): _"It is important to note that you should not add too many filterlists to Adblock Plus"_
- Longer battery life: each time unit, however small, in which the CPU is idle rather than churning translates into extended battery life.
- Free to use a blocker on less powerful devices
    - For instance: [Reddit: _"ABP was a significant burden on my CPU"_](http://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/298jh1/just_a_tip_try_out_%C2%B5block_for_your_adblocking/)
- Free to use more extensions

Memory and CPU cycles are finite resources. A sure way for a developer to **not** be hired when being interviewed is to dismiss efficiency work because "memory is plentiful" or "CPU nowadays are fast enough".
