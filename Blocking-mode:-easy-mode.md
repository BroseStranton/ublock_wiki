This is uBlock Origin's default mode.

Ads are blocked through _EasyList_ and _ Peter Lowe’s Ad server list_, and privacy exposure is reduced through the use of _EasyPrivacy_. Some malware filter lists are selected by default. Also, uBlock Origin's own filter lists are selected as complement to the selected 3rd-party filter lists.

This mode is suitable for those who are concerned about reducing their privacy exposure.

##### Characteristics
