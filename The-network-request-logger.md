uBlock comes with a network request logger, which gives the ability to inspect network requests, whether they were blocked or allowed, and which filter, if any, matched a network request.

To access the network request logger, click on the _list_ icon of ÂµBlock's popup UI:

The request logger will open in a new tab (which was moved to its own window below):

Take note that the network request logger in uBlock is a forward-looking logger: this means only future requests can be logged. In the spirit of efficiency, uBlock will log network requests for a tab **if and only if** there is a logger opened for that tab.

### Components

#### Page selector

The drop-down selector is to display log entries which are related to a specific page. This will hide from view all log entries which are not related to the selected page. By selecting _All_ again, all log entries will be displayed again.

Note in the figure above the entry named _"Behind the scene"_: selecting this entry allows you to see behind-the-scene display network requests which do not originate from any specific tab. [More about this here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Behind-the-scene-network-requests).

#### Reload

The big reload button aside the page selector is to force a reload of the content of the selected page. This button is enabled only for when a specific page is selected.

#### Expand

By default log entries in the logger are collapsed so as to take no more than one line. Some log entries however might be truncated as a result. This button is to force all those entries with truncated extraneous information to be fully visible.

This is to remove all the logged entries.

You can filter entries in the logger using filter expressions. Log entries which do not match _all_ filter expressions will be hidden from view. Syntax for a filter expression:

- Enter `foo` to only show entries which have a string `foo`.
- Enter `|foo` to only show entries which have a field starting with `foo`.
    - Tip: use `|--` to show only entries which were blocked (`--` may work for the most part, but there could be false positives).
- Enter `foo|` to only show entries which have a field ending with `foo`.
- Enter `|foo|` to only show entries which have exactly a field with `foo`.
- Prefix any expression with `!` to reverse the meaning of the expression.
    - `!foo` means display only entries which do not have the string `foo` in it.
    - `!|--` means display only entries which were **not** blocked.
- When more than one filter expression appear, a logical _and_ between the expressions is implied.
- You can _or_ multiple expressions together:
    - `css || image` means display entries which match either `css` or `image`.
    - `xhr || other |http:` means display entries which match either `xhr` or `other` and have a field which starts with `http:`.
    - `!css || image` means display entries which do not match either `css` or `images` (equivalent to `!css !image` really).
    - Warning: With _or_'ed expressions, the _not_ (`!`) operator can only apply to the resulting _or_'ed expression.
- A special keyword can be used to filter behind-the-scene requests: `bts`, or `|bts` for a stricter filtering.

Examples:

- `!|-- facebook`: show only non-blocked entries with the string `facebook` in it.
- `|xhr google`: show only entries of type `XMLHttpRequest` with the work `google` in it.
- `!|image !|css`: show only entries which are not of type `image`, neither `css`.

This is the maximum number of entries allowed in the request logger. When the maximum is reached, the oldest entries at the bottom will be removed to make place to newest entries at the top.

This is useful to be sure the request logger does not unduly consume a huge amount of memory if left open for long period of time. Usually, the most recent entries are the ones of interest. When this value is not set, there is a built-in limit of 25,000 entries.

One could leave the logger opened for long period of time with the _"Behind the scene"_ selected to find out what the browser and other installed extensions are doing behind the scene.
