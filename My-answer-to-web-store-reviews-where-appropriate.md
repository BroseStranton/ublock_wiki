I can't answer to the review in web stores. It's unfortunate as sometimes I could help fix the problem(s), or correct inaccuracies, but the review area is not a forum, so I understand the limitations. Still, I will answer here to those reviews for which I have something meaningful to say.

**My answer:** The problem with the comment section at [Star-Telegram](http://www.star-telegram.com/) is due to the use of _EasyPrivacy_ list. I found the problem also occurs with _Adblock Plus_ if _EasyPrivacy_ is checked. ([test page](http://www.star-telegram.com/2014/06/24/5922649/us-plans-child-migrant-processing.html) where I spotted the problem.)

June 28: Found that problem is that `http://media.star-telegram.com/mistats/sites/dfw/startelegram.js` is being filtered by `/mistats/*` in _EasyPrivacy_. `@@||media.star-telegram.com/mistats/sites/dfw/startelegram.js^$domain=star-telegram.com` has been added to the project's own filters to fix the problem.

Ok. I am willing to work to improve it though. But I do realize that regardless how I try to make it better, there will always be people ready to rate as low as possible. I mean some people disliked [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIJzCeYsy2c), or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlJ0ATDkxko), so an uninspiring computer tool which will be remembered by nobody in some near future has magnitude more chance to be completely thumbed down.
