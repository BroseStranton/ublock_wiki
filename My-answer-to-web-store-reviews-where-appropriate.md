I can't answer to the review in web stores. It's unfortunate as sometimes I could help fix the problem(s), or correct inaccuracies, but the review area is not a forum, so I understand the limitations. Still, I will answer here to those reviews for which I have something meaningful to say.

**My answer:** The problem with the comment section at [Star-Telegram](http://www.star-telegram.com/) is due to the use of _EasyPrivacy_ list. I found the problem also occurs with _Adblock Plus_ if _EasyPrivacy_ is checked. ([test page](http://www.star-telegram.com/2014/06/24/5922649/us-plans-child-migrant-processing.html) where I spotted the problem.)
