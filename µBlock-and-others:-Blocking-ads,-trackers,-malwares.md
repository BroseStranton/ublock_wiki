Hard data, not hype.

Latest benchmark: 30 September 2014 ([raw data spreadsheet](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/master/doc/benchmarks/privex-201409-30.ods)).

This benchmark is to measure privacy exposure, by counting the number of **distinct 3rd-party domains** which
have been hit by net requests during the benchmark. The lower the number of distinct 3rd-party domains hit, the better.

Some benchmarks measure the amount of requests blocked, which I think is of no interest as a useful
measurement of privacy exposure. The number of requests blocked is no guarantee of less distinct 3rd-party domains being hit (and leaving a trace in the servers' logs).

Measuring directly the number of distinct 3rd-party domains which were hit is a much better and relevant measurement for comparison of privacy protection efficiency in my opinion.

Caveat: "3rd-party" is defined as a domain which doesn't match the domain of the web page. For sure many 
domains reported as "3rd-party" actually belong to the same entity which owns the page domain (for example, `yimg.com` is owned by `yahoo.com`). There is no way for the benchmark code to know this, unless using a comprehensive database of who owns which domain -- that is beyond my means. Still, the benchmark is useful if comparing blockers among themselves, or against when no blocker is used.

Results -- figures are "3rd party / all". Ordered from least 3rd-party hits to most 3rd-party hits. Privacy-wise, lower numbers are better.

### Notes

The figures show the number of requests **allowed**, thus lower numbers are better. 
The point is to count the number of distinct 3rd-party/1st-party pairs after running 
the reference benchmark (three repeats in the current instance).

The less distinct 3rd-party/1st-party pairs, the better.

I included µBlock with [my own selection of lists](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-lists:-gorhill), to show that you can easily turn µBlock into a much more aggressive privacy exposure-reducing blocker.

### Methodology

All blockers were configured in such a way as to compare apples-vs-apples:

- **Ghostery:** Select all trackers. _"GhostRank"_ not checked. _"Update now"_ clicked (and ensured whatever new filters were used).
- **µBlock:** out-of-the-box settings + local mirroring enabled (through _"Experimental features"_).
- **µBlock (gorhill):** see [_"Filter lists: gorhill"_](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-lists:-gorhill).
- **Adblock Plus:** _"EasyList"_ + _"EasyPrivacy"_, _"Fanboy's Social Block List"_, _"Malware Domains"_ checked. _"Acceptable ads"_ unchecked. _"Update now"_ clicked.
- **Disconnect:** out-of-the-box settings -- no change.

Browser settings (if you mind your privacy, there is no way around these settings):
- _"Click to play"_ enabled.
- _"Block third party cookies and site data"_ enabled.

[Sessbench](https://github.com/gorhill/sessbench) was used to run the benchmarks, 
and each extension was tested as the only extension active in the browser.

The official [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/list/) is used to determine the domain of a URL.

**Note regarding the methodology:** It has been said that I was unfair toward ABP because I didn't
use [Peter Lowe’s Ad server](http://pgl.yoyo.org/) list for ABP while I did for µBlock. It is
true that I could have imported the list into ABP, which most certainly account for the difference
between ABP and µBlock. My answer to this is available at [Wilders Security Forum](http://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/%C2%B5block-a-lean-and-fast-blocker.365273/page-3#post-2386023).
