The per-site switches allows you to control uBlock's behavior on a per-site basis.

![Popup UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/doc/img/popup-1g.png)

- [No popups](#no-popups)
- [No large media elements](#no-large-media-elements)
- [No cosmetic filtering](#no-cosmetic-filtering)
- [No remote fonts](#no-remote-fonts)
- [No CSP reports](#no-csp-reports)

## No popups

By default popups are allowed unless there is a filter to block them. When this setting is enabled, **all** popups will be unconditionally blocked for the current site, regardless of filters:

![Popup UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/doc/img/popup-1i.png)<br><sup>No popups for the current site: [Try it](http://jessehakanen.net/adblockpluspopupaddon/test.html)</sup>

Blocking popups depends on whether the proper filters are present in the selected filter lists, so this feature is most useful when a site creates popups for which there are no filters to take care of them in 3rd-party filter lists.

**Caveat for Chromium-based browsers:** Due to Chromium API limitations, it's not _always_ possible for uBlock Origin to determine for sure whether a new tab being opened is that of a popup, or is the result of a legitimate click on a link by the user. So if the no-popups switch is in use, you _may_ not be able to open a link in a new tab through the context menu.

## No large media elements

The second icon is to toggle on/off the blocking of large media elements for the current site. The primary purpose of this feature is to save bandwidth. Side effect is to possibly speed up page load.

![Popup UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/doc/img/popup-1h.png)<br><sup>The badge shows the number of large media elements that have been blocked on the page.</sup>

By default, this setting is disabled. The global default can be enabled in the _Settings_ pane in the dashboard.

The threshold size -- a global setting -- to decide when to block or not is also configurable. The threshold size can be set to zero: this will cause all media elements to be blocked. For the sake of documentation, let's refer to media elements (images, videos, audios) which are larger than the set size as _"large media elements"_.

You can enable/disable on a per-site basis, there is a switch in the popup panel to toggle for the current site.

When large media elements have been blocked on a page, you may force a reload of these elements interactively: if you hover over the placeholder of a blocked image and the cursor changes into a magnifier, this means that clicking on a blocked image will force a reload of that image.

If you use this feature and large media elements were blocked on a web page, the context menu will contain a new entry: _"Temporarily allow large media elements"_. When you click this entry, uBO will disable temporarily the blocking of large media element for the site, and attempt to load the blocked media elements without re-loading the page. In some cases you may need to force a reload of the page, for example if large media elements were fetched programmatically by the page. The temporary disabling will be removed for a tab as soon as you travel to a new site, or close the tab.

Blocked large media elements are reported in the logger with the filter `no-large-media: [scope] true`.

Note that this feature has no privacy value: a connection to the remote server must be performed in order to fetch the size of the resource. This of course applies only to resources which were not otherwise blocked by uBO's filtering engine.

Examples of usefulness (let's say you just stumbled onto these pages not knowing whether the article would really interest you), bandwidth consumed:

- <http://www.wired.com/2016/01/drones-arent-just-toys-anymore>
    - Not blocking large media elements: 5.5 MB.
    - Blocking media elements larger than 1 MB: 2.1 MB.
    - Blocking media elements larger than 50 kB: 1.2 MB.
- <http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/samsung-gear-vr-headset,4405.html>
    - Not blocking large media elements: 15.1 MB.
    - Blocking media elements larger than 1 MB: 15.1 MB.
    - Blocking media elements larger than 50 kB: 61 kB.
- <https://twitter.com/> (your Twitter stream):
    - Not loading largish images by default can help Twitter page performance: click on a placeholder to load only the images which seems to be of interest to you.
    - This is true for any "infinite scrolling" web pages ([another example](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/being-illegal-won-t-keep-drones-from-taking-over-india)). Not loading the images by default help a lot in such cases.

## No cosmetic filtering

"Cosmetic filtering" in uBO is what is known as ["element hiding"](https://adblockplus.org/filters#elemhide) in Adblock Plus.

You can easily toggle on/off cosmetic filtering for a given site:

![Popup UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/doc/img/popup-1j.png)<br><sup>The badge shows the number of DOM elements that have been hidden on the page.</sup>

When present, the badge number indicates the number of elements hidden on the page by uBO as a result of cosmetic filtering. If you disable cosmetic filtering while there are hidden elements on the page, these elements will become visible/hidden as you toggle off/on cosmetic filtering.

A good example of cosmetic filtering in action are the ads showing up with the results of a Google Search page ([example](https://www.google.com/search?q=buy+car&oq=buy+car)).

Cosmetic filtering is always enabled by default.

> ***
> **Tips**
>
> It is often suggested adding a custom static filter such as `@@||example.com^$elemhide` or `@@||example.com^$generichide` to prevent "adblock" detection by specific sites ([example](https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=30763#p124225), [example](https://adblockplus.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=43961)). You can accomplish the same goal more simply by just toggling off cosmetic filtering using this switch while on the problematic site.
> 
> This switch can help uBO to further lower its CPU-cycle footprint, which might be beneficial on devices with limited CPU-cycle resources -- and thus helping extend battery life and speed up page load times. The idea is to disable cosmetic filtering everywhere by default, and to enable it only for those sites which really benefit from it.
> ***

To disable cosmetic filtering everywhere by default, go to the [_Settings_ pane in the dashboard](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Settings), and check the option _"Disable cosmetic filtering"_ under the _"Default behavior"_ header. From then on, cosmetic filtering will be turned off everywhere by default, and to turn it on for a specific site where it is really needed, just enable it using the switch in uBO's popup panel.

## No remote fonts

You can prevent web fonts from being downloaded for the current site:

![Popup UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gorhill/uBlock/master/doc/img/popup-1k.png)<br><sup>The badge shows the number of font resources that have been blocked on the page.</sup>

Because of security and privacy concerns, many prefer to block all web fonts by default. You can do this by adding the following rule directly in the _"My rules"_ pane in the dashboard:

    no-remote-fonts: * true

This will block all web fonts everywhere by default, and in this case you can toggle off the switch to allow web fonts on a per-site basis.

***

## No CSP reports

You can block network requests made as a result of your browser reporting Content Security Policy violations ("CSP reports") to a remote server (which can be 3rd-party to the site where the violation occurred).

Consider this excerpt from [Reporting API / Privacy Considerations](http://wicg.github.io/reporting/#privacy) (my emphasis):

> 8.6. Disabling Reporting
> 
> [...]
> 
> That said, it canâ€™t be the case that this general benefit be allowed to take priority over the ability of a user to individually opt-out of such a system. Sending reports costs bandwidth, and potentially could reveal some small amount of additional information above and beyond what a website can obtain in-band ([NETWORK-ERROR-LOGGING], for instance). **User agents MUST allow users to disable reporting with some reasonable amount of granularity in order to maintain the priority of constituencies espoused in [HTML-DESIGN-PRINCIPLES].**

There is currently no way to easily toggle CSP reporting in either Chromium of Firefox. This per-site switch is to address this shortcoming.

Note that this switch is not currently available in the popup panel. However it is available as a global setting in the _Settings_ pane in uBO's dashboard, so that you can easily disable/enable CSP reporting globally.

More advanced users can use the usual per-site switch syntax to more narrowly control the enabling/disabling of CSP report-related network requests:

    no-csp-reports: example.com false

Note that as opposed to all other network requests, behind-the-scene network requests which are actual CSP report will also be filtered out according to `no-csp-reports` switch. So if you globally disable CSP reporting in uBO, this will also apply to behind-the-scene network requests.
