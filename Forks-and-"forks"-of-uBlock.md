It's just a matter of time before forks and "forks" of uBlock are spotted. So here is what I have so far:

- [AdBlock Gold Edition](https://github.com/GoldbarVentures/adblock-gold-edition) (Github)
    - from "Quickrr"
    - A copy-cat of the code, with the UI code mostly commented out, only the whitelist pane is accessible.
    - The project mentions: "Used under GPLv3 from uBlock".
    - Logo resembles that of Adblock Plus, except for the letters, "ABG".
    - Update: apparently removed from store as of April 20, 2015?
- [adBlock Extension by Goldbar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-extension-by-gold/blabcjmaafmcbofhmjlpeehcmpdlgibo) (Chrome store)
    - from "chrome.apps"
    - A copy-cat of the code, with the UI code mostly commented out, only the whitelist pane is accessible -- just like "AdBlock Gold Edition" above.
    - The project mentions: "Used under GPLv3 from uBlock".
    - Logo resembles that of Adblock Plus, except for the letters, "ABF".
    - Named changed from "AdBlock Plus Free" to "adBlock Extension by Goldbar" on April 20, 2015.
- [Madblock Ad Blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/madblock-ad-blocker/lhbfhcbgmodeoikiccebpomdmkcccaem) (Chrome store)
    - Mention "based on the open source project uBlock".
    - Link to `http://madblock.org` which appears to be a stale domain name.
