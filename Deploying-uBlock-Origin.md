I do not know much about that administrator stuff, so I will let a knowledgeable person guide you:

### Customizing the settings

Administrators can force specific configurations to deployed uBlock Origin ("uBO"). At launch time, uBO will look for a setting named `adminSettings`, and if it exists, it will parse, extract and overwrite a user's settings with the administrator-assigned ones.

New standalone settings are being added as per demand, see ["Deploying uBlock Origin: configuration"](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/wiki/Deploying-uBlock-Origin:-configuration).

For **Firefox**, refer to Mozilla documentation about ["Native manifests"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests) (sections about ["Managed storage manifests"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests#Managed_storage_manifests) and [its location](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests#Manifest_location)). You can also consult [this specific comment](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/2986#issuecomment-364035002) in uBO issue tracker.

For **Firefox-legacy**, the `adminSettings` entry must be added to `about:config`, the key name is `extensions.ublock0.adminSettings`, and the value is a plain string -- which must be JSON-parseable.

For **Chrome**, `adminSettings` must be an entry part of the policy for the extension. See <http://www.chromium.org/administrators/configuring-policy-for-extensions>.

For managing **Chrome** via **Google Workspace** you can use this apps-script to generate a policy JSON that will modify Trusted Sites for all designated users.
<https://github.com/Landsil/apps_script--GSuite_API/blob/master/uBlock_Origin_GSuite_policy.gs>

This is still a work in progress, there are limitations. For example, it is not possible to merge an admin's settings with the user's ones -- a setting can only be overwritten. Hopefully I will address this limitation eventually, as time permit. (See https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/832#issuecomment-248138558).

The content of `adminSettings` is pretty straightforward: configure uBO as you wish for your users, then create a backup using the _"Backup to file"_ in the _Settings_ pane. Now open this backup file using a text editor, and remove all entries you do not want to overwrite, while taking care to end up with a valid JSON file (mind trailing commas, etc.). All the entries left are the ones which will be overwritten on the user's side.

An example, I created a backup file after having customized uBO, and removed everything except for the _"Color-blind friendly"_ setting, to force that setting to be set on the user's side. Resulting text file:

    {
      "userSettings": {
        "colorBlindFriendly": true
      }
    }

Now, the value for `adminSettings` must itself be a plain string, and this means we need to encode the above text into a string, using `JSON.stringify`. Here is a small utility to help you deal with this step: <http://raymondhill.net/ublock/adminSetting.html>.


### Modifying the list of stock assets

Content of the "Filter lists" tab can be configured by providing custom version of the [`assets.json`](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/blob/16a0ebbfb05c4582ecc68454ba3b45b403164dde/assets/assets.json) file.

URL of the modified `assets.json` file must be added in `assetsBootstrapLocation` key.

Implementation, see: [#2314](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/pull/2314)
