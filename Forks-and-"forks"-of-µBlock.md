It's just a matter of time before forks and "forks" of ÂµBlock are spotted. So here is what I have so far:

- [AdBlock Gold Edition](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-gold-edition/kmooncpopldajlgigepneepagpcnehgg)
    - "from Quickrr"
    - A copy-cat of the code, with the UI mostly commented out, only the whitelist pane is accessible.
    - The project mentions: "Used under GPLv3 from uBlock".
