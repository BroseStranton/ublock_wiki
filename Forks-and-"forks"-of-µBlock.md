It's just a matter of time before forks and "forks" of uBlock are spotted. So here is what I have so far:

- [AdBlock Gold Edition](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-gold-edition/kmooncpopldajlgigepneepagpcnehgg) (Chrome store)
    - from "Quickrr"
    - A copy-cat of the code, with the UI code mostly commented out, only the whitelist pane is accessible.
    - The project mentions: "Used under GPLv3 from uBlock".
    - Logo resembles that of Adblock Plus, except for the letters, "ABG".
- [AdBlock Plus Free](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free/blabcjmaafmcbofhmjlpeehcmpdlgibo) (Chrome store)
    - from "chrome.apps"
    - A copy-cat of the code, with the UI code mostly commented out, only the whitelist pane is accessible -- just like "AdBlock Gold Edition" above.
    - The project mentions: "Used under GPLv3 from uBlock".
    - Logo resembles that of Adblock Plus, except for the letters, "ABF".
