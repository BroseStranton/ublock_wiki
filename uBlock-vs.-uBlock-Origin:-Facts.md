#### Chris Aljoudi is "the creator of uBlock"

Completely false.

[Chris Aljoudi](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi) was [one of the lesser contributors](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors) when he was handed over **maintainership** on April 1st:

Before being handed over **maintainership**, he was taking care to further develop the Safari port of uBlock, which was first [brought entirely to life](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/commits/master/platform/safari?page=3) by another developer, [Deathamns](https://github.com/Deathamns).

Since being handed over the project, his _own_ uBlock work has _mostly_ consisted of [re-skinning uBlock](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/releases).

So to call him the "creator of uBlock" is a quite low blow to those who actually did all the real hard work to make uBlock what it is today.

Completely false.

I handed over **maintainership**, upon which I _immediately_ created a fork of my own project so that I could continue to work in a more quiet environment -- as my own time had become dedicated to answer spurious issues on GitHub.

See my [commit history](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/commits/master): at no point did I stop working on uBlock. And as far as I am concerned, this worked, as I finally could immediately find the time to do actual code and work to finally resolve [long](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/58) [standing](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/68) [issues](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/issues/308), while bringing in new features. See [release history](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases) for details (the fork occurred right before 0.9.3.0).
