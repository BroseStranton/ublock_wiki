The experimental filters are filters being evaluated for inclusion in uBlock Origin's default set of filters. They are being evaluated to assess whether they cause undue web page breakages.

The _Experimental_ filters are disabled by default, enable only if you want to help evaluate/fine tune these filters.

If you find web pages broken by one of these filters, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues) with all the proper details<sup>[1]</sup> **IF AND ONLY IF** you are able to confirm that one of the experimental filter is causing the web page breakage.
