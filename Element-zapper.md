The element zapper can temporarily remove elements on a web page without creating new filters. The [[element picker]] can permanently remove elements on a web page by using it to create a network or cosmetic filter.

Useful for quick removal of nuisance elements on a web page.

We may visit a web page on a website for which we do not intend to become a regular visitor, and many sites nowadays will throw nuisance visual elements preventing us from accessing the content. Often we would prefer not to go through the process of creating filters for just that one visit. The element zapper mode is convenient in this use case. You can quickly remove the nuisance visual element without having to pollute your filter set for this single visit.

All web browser developer tools already include this feature, but the purpose of the element zapper is to make it easy for anyone to use. Just highlight and click with no need to open the developer tools.

Additionally, depending on what element you are zapping, the element zapper will try to detect and deal with the web pages preventing scrolling through the entire content.

### Once you enter the "element-zapper mode":

- Highlighting and clicking an element will remove it from the web page and exit element zapper mode.
    - Press the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while clicking if you do not want to exit element zapper mode.
- Highlighting an element and then pressing the <kbd>Delete</kbd> key will remove it from the web page without quitting the element zapper mode.
- Pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key will exit element zapper mode.

### On touch screen devices:

- Tap once to select the element.
- Tap the highlighted element to remove it.
- Swipe right to remove the incorrect highlighting.
- Swipe right to exit element zapper mode.

Reloading the web page will cause all removed elements to return.
