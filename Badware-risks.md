The sites below are included in the _"uBlock filters – Badware risks"_. The sites are documented to be [badware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) risks. To quote Wikipedia:

> Spyware or other malware is sometimes found embedded in programs supplied officially by companies, e.g., downloadable from websites, that appear useful or attractive, but may have, for example, additional hidden tracking functionality that gathers marketing statistics.

Note the word "risks": not necessarily all downloads on a site may be affected by badware. The block page is there to _remind_ the user to be cautious, and the user is free to dismiss temporarily or permanently the blocked page for the site ahead.

uBlock is not an antivirus, the sole purpose is to _remind_ a user of what is ahead, and the feature is more useful to non-technical users, who are more likely to be the target of badware.

Below are sites currently part of the list, and links giving further information as to why. Feel free to add _good_ sources if you find more.
