At this point, uBlock Origin does not ship with any experimental features.

The experimental local mirroring feature ([page history](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Experimental-features/7148ff9bd4e6077aecf00077f7836028c82b5f35#privacy-exposure-reduction-local-mirroring)) has been removed for good. There's a browser extension for Firefox, Chrome, and Opera, which purpose is similar to what local mirroring meant to accomplish.
