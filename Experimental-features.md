There is currently no experimental features in uBlock Origin.

There used to be "local mirroring" (see [older versions of this page](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Experimental-features/_history)), but this has been removed for good. There is a new extension for Firefox which purpose is similar, see [Decentralizeyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/).
