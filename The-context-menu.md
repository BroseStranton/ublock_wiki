Currently, these uBlock Origin items may be visible in the browser's context menu:
- _"Block element..."_, which purpose is to launch the [element picker](./Element-picker) in order to filter out a specific element on a page
- _"Block element in frame.."_, like above, but will allow creating filters in frame elements embedded in other pages, for example in YouTube video embedded in Reddit thread.<sup>[1]</sup>
- _"Subscribe to filter list..."_, which will allow filter list subscription through the context menu (in link context).<sup>[2]</sup>
- [_"Temporarily allow large media elements"_](./Per-site-switches#no-large-media-elements) which will temporarily remove bandwidth saving restriction for current page.
